# Building Construction Optimizer

This Python script implements an innovative optimization method for finding optimal building constructions, taking into account not only technical constraints but also economic and environmental factors. It utilizes a mathematical model, optimization algorithms from the `scipy` library, and a machine learning model based on TensorFlow to predict economic and environmental indicators.

## Functionality

- **Generating Data for Machine Learning Model:**
  - Generates or loads data to be used for training the machine learning model. In the example, random data is generated representing features and labels (target variable).

- **Creating and Training Machine Learning Model:**
  - Creates a machine learning model using the TensorFlow library. A simple neural network with one hidden layer is used in the example. The model is compiled with a chosen optimizer and loss function, and then trained on the provided data.

- **Evaluating Building Construction:**
  - Implements the `evaluate_building_construction` function, which evaluates the building construction based on the provided parameters. This function is called during optimization to compute the value of the objective function.

- **Optimization:**
  - Executes optimization of the building construction using the `minimize` function from the `scipy` library. The `evaluate_building_construction` function is used as the objective function, which also considers predicted values of economic and environmental indicators.

- **Outputting Results:**
  - After optimization completes, the optimal variable values and the value of the objective function are printed.

## Note
To run this script, you need to install the `numpy`, `scipy`, and `tensorflow` libraries. You also need to prepare or load data for training the machine learning model.
